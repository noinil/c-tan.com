# Biography

I am currently a postdoc in the Department of Biophysics at Kyoto University.  I
have started my postdoctoral research in
[Prof. Shoji Takada's laboratory](http://theory.biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index_e.php) since 2014.
My current research interests include functional mechanisms of DNA-binding
proteins, the multi-scale organization of the genome, and modeling of
biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations.

I used to be a free software fanatic, with up to 10+ years of experience with
various Linux distributions.  For a long time, I was proud of having a signature
of RMS on my doctoral dissertation. But now I prefer to use the paid software,
to save my time and to focus on important things. Still, I have Arch Linux
installed on my VPS.

When I was young, I bought thousands of classical music CDs and listened to 10%
of them. I bought all the cello concerto scores I was able to find, pretending
to read 5% of them. Although I always enjoyed being an amateur.

In order to participate in a sport without any physical contact, I started
practicing the Rubik's cube in 2009, and I was lucky enough to break a national
record in a game in 2010.  So I stopped practicing since then.

Anyway, welcome to my personal website!
