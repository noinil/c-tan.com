# Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Biophysics
Research Team at RIKEN.  I have started my current job since May, 2019.  My
research interests include functional mechanisms of DNA-protein binding,
multi-scale organization of the genome, liquid-liquid phase separation in gene
expression, and modeling of biomolecules in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
Besides, I write code for MD softwares
[GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/) and
[CafeMol](http://www.cafemol.org/index.php).

I used to be a free software fanatic (FSF), with up to 10+ years of using
various Linux distributions.  But now I prefer to use many paid softwares, if
available, to save my time and to focus more on truely interesting things.

In order to participate in a sport without any physical contact, I started
practicing the Rubik's cube from 2009, and I broke the national record for the
$2\times 2$ cube in a game in 2010.  Unfortunately, I stopped practicing since then.
