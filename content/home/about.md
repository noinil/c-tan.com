# Biography

I am currently a postdoc in the Department of Biophysics at Kyoto University.
I have started my postdoctoral research in [Prof. Shoji Takada's
laboratory](http://theory.biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index_e.php) since 2014.  My
current research interests include functional mechanisms of DNA-protein
binding, the multi-scale organization of the genome, and modeling of
biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations.

I used to be a free software fanatic (FSF, :D), with up to 10+ years of
experience on various Linux distributions.  For a long time, I was proud of
having a signature from RMS on my doctoral dissertation.  But now I prefer to
use the paid softwares to save my time and to focus on really important things.

In order to participate in a sport without any physical contact, I started
practicing the Rubik's cube in 2009, and I was lucky enough to break a national
record in a game in 2010.  And I stopped practicing since then.

Anyway, welcome to my personal website!
