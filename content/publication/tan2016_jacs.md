abstract = "Protein binding to DNA changes the DNA’s structure, and altered DNA structure can, in turn, modulate the dynamics of protein binding. This mutual dependency is poorly understood. Here we investigated dynamic couplings among protein binding to DNA, protein sliding on DNA, and DNA bending by applying a coarse-grained simulation method to the bacterial architectural protein HU and 14 other DNA-binding proteins. First, we veriﬁed our method by showing that the simulated HU exhibits a weak preference for A/T-rich regions of DNA and a much higher aﬃnity for gapped and nicked DNA, consistent with biochemical experiments. The high aﬃnity was attributed to a local DNA bend, but not the speciﬁc chemical moiety of the gap/nick. The long-time dynamic analysis revealed that HU sliding is associated with the movement of the local DNA bending site. Deciphering single sliding steps, we found the coupling between HU sliding and DNA bending is akin to neither induced-ﬁt nor population-shift; instead they moved concomitantly. This is reminiscent of a cation transfer on DNA and can be viewed as a protein version of polaron-like sliding. Interestingly, on shorter time scales, HU paused when the DNA was highly bent at the bound position and escaped from pauses once the DNA spontaneously returned to a less bent structure. The HU sliding is largely regulated by DNA bending dynamics. With 14 other proteins, we explored the generality and versatility of the dynamic coupling and found that 6 of the 15 assayed proteins exhibit the polaron-like sliding."

abstract_short = "The correlation between protein binding to DNA and DNA bending has been observed in many protein-DNA complex structures. These are, however, the correlation in static structures. Due to time and spatial resolutions in experiments, little is known on the dynamic coupling between protein binding and DNA bending. Here, armed with new simulation methods, we investigated the dynamic coupling between protein binding and DNA bending for a bacterial protein HU and 14 other proteins. The sliding of positively-charged HU on negatively-charged DNA is highly coupled with local DNA distortion, which is reminiscent of polaron in physics. In shorter time scale, HU was self-trapped in a locally bent DNA leading to pauses. Spontaneous relaxation in DNA shape resulted in the sliding mode."
