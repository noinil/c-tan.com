I have started my current job in the [Computational Biophysics Research Team at RIKEN Center for Computational Science](http://www2.riken.jp/TMS2012/cbp/en/index.html) since May, 2019. 
My research interests include functional mechanisms of DNA-protein binding, multi-scale organization of the genome, liquid-liquid phase separation in gene expression, and modeling of biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations. Besides, I write code for MD softwares [GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/) and [CafeMol](http://www.cafemol.org/index.php).

I used to be a free software fanatic (FSF), with up to 10+ years' experience of
using various Linux distributions. But now I prefer to use paid softwares as
much as possible, if available, to save my time and to focus more on truely
interesting things.

In order to participate in a sport without any physical contact, I started
practicing the Rubik's cube from 2009, and I broke the Chinese national record
for the 2×2 cube in a game in 2010. Unfortunately, I lost the passion to keep
practicing since then.  You can find my official records from [World Cube
Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009TANC02).
