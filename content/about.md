I joined the [Computational Biophysics Research Team at RIKEN Center for Computational Science](http://www2.riken.jp/TMS2012/cbp/en/index.html) in May 2019, where I currently work. One of my primary responsibilities is to develop code for molecular dynamics software [GENESIS](https://mdgenesis.org/) (and [CafeMol](http://www.cafemol.org) in my last job). My research interests in computational biophysics are:
- Modeling biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations,
- Biomolecular condensation via liquid-liquid phase separation,
- Functional conformational changes of protein and DNA,
- Multi-scale organization of the genome.

In addition to my professional work, I enjoy participating in non-contact sports, and in 2009, I began practicing the Rubik's cube. My passion and dedication paid off in 2010, when I set a new Chinese national record for the 2×2×2 cube during a competition. Although I have not maintained the same level of practice since then, I am still proud of my achievement and encourage others to pursue their hobbies and passions outside of work. For those interested, my official records can be found on the [World Cube Association website](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009TANC02).
