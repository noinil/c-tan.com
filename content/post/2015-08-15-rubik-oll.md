## About OLL

There are in total 57 OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer) cases in the CFOP
method.  Actually it's not necessary to learn all of them to solve a cube.
Many people use only 10 of them, in a two-step manenr, which is often called
double-O in the "CFOOP" strategy.  Based on my personal experience, you don't
have to remembere all of them to get an average of 17s.

Here I show a chart of all the 57 OLL algorithms.  They are organized in a
two-dimensional way: rows/columns represent different cases of edges/corners,
respectively.  Yellow is the color of the upper face.
