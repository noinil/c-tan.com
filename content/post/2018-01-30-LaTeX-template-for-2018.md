After trying all kinds of ways to taking notes for some years, at the beginning of 2018, I finally came back to the idea that it would be more appropriate to typeset a research note with $\LaTeX$. Therefore on New Year's Day, I decided to design a template for this year's notes. After some learning, I finally come up with a  satisfactory configuration. Here I show the effects of using this model to typeset a Japanese textbook.

Since it is for personal use, and I hope my layout to be a unique design, I will not release the source code.

### Acknowledgements

I learned a lot from this project: [nexus.sty](https://github.com/alexisflesch/nexus)


## Effects

- One color theme per chapter.  The uniform color (for every chapter) is applied to the substructures (like sections and subsections).
- In the sidebar, there is a column of small dots, which cross-links to different chapters. The color of dot also matches the color of the corresponding chapter.
