Happy new year!

I got a new task to write a document for CG models in MD simulations.  After
some discussions with other members, I decided to use $\LaTeX$ directly, instead
of markdown or other languages.  To be honest, I always feel no more difficulty
of using $\LaTeX$ than any other languages in Emacs, even org.  Especially, when
there are a number of user-defined `\newcommand`s, it's mroe directly to use
$\LaTeX$-mode, in which I can conveniently define and make use of macros.

Happy $\LaTeX$ing!
