DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are biopolymers named
nucleic acids, made from monomers known as nucleotides[^1].  Each nucleotide has
three components: a 5-carbon sugar (in DNA deoxyribose, and in RNA ribose), a
phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.  Many coarse-grained models divide
nucleic acids in this way[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3].
