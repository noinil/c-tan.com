Inspired by [Windsor Schmidt](http://windsorschmidt.com/tag/latex/), I made a
similar note template in $\LaTeX$.  I plotted the background figure using
*Inkscape*.  Additionally, with the `background` package in $\TeX$ Live, it's
possible to set different backgrounds for odd and even pages separately.
