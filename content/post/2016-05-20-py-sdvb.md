## Just another vocabulary building tool

When I was on Linux, I used to look English words up in StarDict.  After
changing to macOS, using dictionary is much easier, with only three fingers
clicking the unkown word.  Although, this is still not flexible enough.

Here I present a stupid simple tool written in Python3, which can perform
regular expression search in StarDict dictionaries.  With this tool, one can do
some interesting explorations into the ocean of words.

I named this as `py-sdvb`, meaning "Python3 StarDict Vocabulary Builder".
Unfortunately, the user has to write a dictionary file first, in the format of
StarDict.  Optionally one can try to download the dictionary files from
Internet.  Please be cautious of the copyright problems.


## Installation
---

- Py-sdvb is now available on PyPI.  Use `pip` (python3 version) to install:

```bash
pip3 install py-sdvb
```
    

- Alternatively, one can fork or download the project from Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noinil/py_sdvb ~/py-sdvb
```


### Prerequisites for manual installation

This package is based on `PyStarDict` (https://github.com/lig/pystardict).


### Limitations

At the current stage, `py-sdvb` is only tested for python3.5 (and higher
versinos) on macOS.


## Usage
---

Move the dictionary files into `~/.stardict/`.

Simply run `pysdcv` and `pysdvb`.
