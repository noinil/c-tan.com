Last year I posted about my $\LaTeX$-created PDF planner, and I have got many emails asking for the source code.  Sorry that I didn't have time to reply to everyone.  But now, I decided to make it open source.  I reorganized my code to put essential functions into a `.sty` file and the "contents" of each block into separate `.tex` files.  The package accepts two arguments:

1. `palette`: color scheme (value: one of `["spring", "autumn", "summer", "winter"]`);
2. `year`: the year to generate the calendars.

Please get the code from: https://github.com/noinil/etechou
