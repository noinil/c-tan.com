Calculation of the solvation energy of biomolecules have been a long-standing
problem for computational biologists.  A bunch of methodologies have been
developed.  However, a satisfying solution is still far away from us.  Here I
show the first simulation study of this problem, with proteins in the
coarse-grained model, whilst with explicit water model.  Our results revealed
striking phenomenons such as bubble formation around the surface of proteins.
If you are angry now, please don't kill me.

Happy CG modeling.
