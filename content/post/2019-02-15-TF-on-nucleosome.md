Last Friday, my boss asked me to make a "fancy" picture on our current work.  I spent the whole weekend to think of what does fancy mean (not really). 
Then I made one like this:

On my macbook this looked very nice.  I also tested this on my iphone and it was, may I say, fantastic.  Especially if I turned off all the lights.
It was like a sapphire necklace put on a piece of black velvet.
But then I was afraid it would be "too fancy" for an academic print.

Luckly, after I sent it to my boss on Tuesday, I was told that the purpose was actually "修士課程学生募集" (recruitment of Master students).  
And I printed it out on paper, and it looked just terrible.  I really think it is time to throw away all the paper prints.  :P

This was another candidate, but I did not show it.  Whereas now I suppose this one is more suitable:

Happy CG modeling.

By the way, I just realized that CG stands both for "computer graphics" and "coarse-graining"!
