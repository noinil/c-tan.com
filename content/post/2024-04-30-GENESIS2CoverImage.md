We recently published our paper about GENESIS 2.1 [^1]. As one of the co-first authors, I contributed the sections on Coarse-Grained (CG) simulations and a series of schematic illustrations.

To increase the paper's visibility, we decided to create a cover image for the journal's website.

To this end, I dusted off my long-dormant Blender skills and combined them with some modest image-editing techniques to produce three different designs.

The version selected by the co-authors is shown below:

Of course, that left two rejected designs, which I’ve decided to archive here on my personal site for your amusement.
