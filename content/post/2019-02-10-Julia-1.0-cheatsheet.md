Here is a cheat sheet for the programming language Julia (v1.0.3).  

![Julia v1.0 cheat sheet.](/img/posts/screenshots/scrot_julia_1.0_cheatsheet_2019-02-10.png)

It might be a bit stupid to make a cheat sheet for a rapidly evolving language.  But for me it's a good chance to go through the documentation, to practice, and to test all the functions listed here.

You can download [Julia 1.0 cheat sheet PDF version.](/download/julia_1.0_cheatsheet_2019-02-10.pdf)

Happy hacking!
