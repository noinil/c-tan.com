I bought an iPad Pro 12.9 and an apple pencil last April.  However I didn't make
good use of these tools.  This year I plan to try to take notes with the pencil
on the iPadOS, despite my ugly handwriting.  I find that many Apps support hyper
links in the PDF files, which provides the probability to implement some cool
ideas.

Here I show a PDF created with $\LaTeX$.  Most importantly, in the file almost
all the dates are cross-linked to each other (via `hyperref`).  I made several
different perspectives, including yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily
pages.  Calendars were mainly produced by `TikZ` and `PGF`, with some
elementary-school math to calculate week numbers.
