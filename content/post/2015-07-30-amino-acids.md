As basic building blocks of proteins, amino acids are biologically fundamental
and important.  So far, there have been around 500 known amino acids which can
be classified in many different ways[^1].  However, only 22 amino acids in
prokaryotes and 21 in eukaryotes are encoded by genes, and are incorporated into
proteins.  These amino acids are called "*proteinogenic*".  Here is a chart of
these most popular amino acids.
